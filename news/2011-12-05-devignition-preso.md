This past Friday I had the pleasure of presenting "The Polyglot Future of JBoss AS" to an audience of 
mostly Java developers at [DevIgnition](http://devignition.com/)
in [NoVA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Virginia).

Thanks to [Gray Herter](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/gray-herter/a/60a/111) for organizing a
great conference, and to [Booz Allen Hamilton](http://www.boozallen.com/) for sharing their
kick-butt conference center.

Here are my slides from that presentation for the enjoyment of all:

And if you are interested in the code for the demo, that's [here](https://github.com/tobias/dev-ignition-demo).

The talk was recorded, so once that recording is available I'll update this post to point to it.
