[JRubyConf EU][jrubyconfeu] is back again this year as part of
[Eurucamp 2014][eurucamp]! JRubyConf EU is a single-track, single-day
event that takes place on August 1st 2014, located at the same venue
as and immediately preceding Eurucamp 2014. Meet fellow JRuby users
and developers on August 1st and stay at Eurucamp through the weekend
to hang out with other Rubyists!

JRubyConf EU Tickets are available for â‚¬99 at the [Eurucamp ticket
site][tickets]. The JRubyConf EU call for papers is still open for a
few more days (until Sunday, May 28th) and we'd love one of our
community members to [submit a talk][cfp] about TorqueBox!
