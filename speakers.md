# Need a speaker at your conference, user-group, or bar mitzvah?

While the TorqueBox team is centered around the southeast United
States, we can normally locate our car keys or find our way
to an airport.

If you'd like to have someone come by, we may be able to arrange
that, depending on the expected audience, and distance from 
an engineer who is willing to go.

While we can normally foot the travel bill ourselves, if your organization
offers travel or lodging assistance, that is of course always
appreciated, but not a requirement.

Just shoot an email to *<span>speakers</span>@torquebox<span>.org</span>*
and we will try to work something out. 

# Want to speak at conferences?

Are you a user of TorqueBox, looking for an opportunity to 
share what you've learned and help introduce others to the project?

We're always happy to help the community prepare for talks, and 
if we get requests for presentations in your area, we'd be glad
to route them to you.

Find us on [IRC](/community#irc), or you may also ping the
*<span>speakers</span>@torquebox<span>.org</span>* address.

Or fork the [torquebox.org site repository](http://github.com/torquebox/torquebox.org/)
and send a patch against [this very page](https://github.com/torquebox/torquebox.org/blob/master/speakers.md),
adding yourself to the roster below.

# Speaking at an upcoming conference?

We like to promote anyone who speaks, anywhere in the world,
right on the front page of this site.  Just let us know when
and where you are speaking, and we'll get it up.

Find us on [IRC](/community#irc), or you may also ping the
*<span>speakers</span>@torquebox<span>.org</span>* address.
